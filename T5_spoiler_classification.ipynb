He is seen delivering a lecture at the Royal Naval Academy in London.Meanwhile, Ryan\\'s wife Cathy and daughter Sally are sightseeing near Buckingham Palace. Sally and Cathy come upon a British Royal Guard, and Sally tries to get the guard to react by doing an improvised tap dance in front of him. She\\'s impressed when the guard, trained to ignore distraction, doesn\\'t react at all, and they leave.As Sally and Cathy walk away from the guard, en route to rendezvous with Ryan, they walk by a stolen cab, in which sit three Ulster Liberation Army terrorists: Kevin O\\'Donnell, the driver, as well as Sean Miller (Sean Bean) and his younger brother Patrick. The three are loading bullets into their guns as they prepare to carry out a scheduled ambush on Lord William Holmes, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and a distant member of the British Royal Family (the cousin of the Queen Mother). As they finish loading their weapons, another terrorist, Annette, radios to them that Lord Holmes is leaving the palace with his wife and son.As Lord Holmes\\'s car leaves the palace, the terrorists\\' car falls in line behind him. They follow the car, headed for the ambush point. As they drive, O\\'Donnell and the Miller brothers don ski masks.Meanwhile, Ryan is about to cross the street to meet with his wife and daughter. He arrives at the same time that Lord Holmes\\'s car is passing through the area.Suddenly, another cab, parked on the side of the road, driven by Annette, pulls out and swerves in front of Lord Holmes\\'s vehicle. Simultaneously, O\\'Donnell\\'s vehicle swerves to a stop behind the car. The Millers and another accomplice jump out and quickly plant a bomb underneath the chauffeured car\\'s engine. Ryan sees what\\'s going on and hastily gets his family to cover just as the bomb is detonated. Moments later, Sean and another accomplice begin shooting into the car, riddling Lord Holmes\\'s driver and bodyguard with bullet. The onslaught of bullets does not kill Lord Holmes, who is currently using his body to shield his family. Sean marches over to the rear door and orders Lord Holmes out of the car at gunpoint. Ryan, unable to stand being just a bystander, immediately breaks cover, runs up behind Miller, and disarms him. As Ryan grabs Sean\\'s pistol, he gets shot in the left shoulder by another terrorist. He shoots one of the other terrorists in the shoulder. Patrick attempts to flee, but Ryan fatally shoots him in the chest. Seeing two of the royal guards racing towards the scene, the remaining terrorists quickly get back in their cars and drive off, leaving Sean to be captured when the authorities arrive. They retreat back to a warehouse, where they change out license plates.While recovering, Ryan is called to testify against Miller as a witness. Subsequently, Miller is convicted on all charges and sentenced to life in prison. Ryan is awarded the order of Knight Commander of the Victorian Order, and eventually returns to the United States.On the possibility that Miller\\'s ULA comrades might try to liberate him, the authorities take no chances. To that extent, they set up decoy convoys on the day that Miller is to be transferred to Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight. However, someone manages to tip off the ULA as to which convoy is carrying Miller. Miller\\'s motorcade is in transit when it comes to a stop at a drawbridge. The raised bridge, however, is a trap meant to block them in. Moments after the convoy comes to a stop, Miller\\'s comrades attack, using rocket launchers to blow up the cars at the front and rear of the convoy. They then march up to the prison van and order the guards out at gunpoint by taking the bridge operator hostage and threatening to shoot him. One of the guards hesitates and is shot fatally. The other officer and the inspector are pulled out, thrown on the ground and forced to lie on their stomachs. O\\'Donnell hands Miller a pistol, with which he coldly executes both officers and the bridge operator by shooting them in the backs of their heads. They then depart the scene.Miller and his companions flee on a cargo ship from Britain to Libya, to prepare for their next kidnapping attempt on Lord Holmes. Miller however, cannot shake his anger towards Ryan for killing his younger brother and persuades several members of his entourage to accompany him to the United States on a short mission targeting Ryan and his family.Miller travels to the United States, accompanied by Annette, comrade Ned Clark, and a fourth henchman. Annette and Clark travel to the United States Naval Academy to ambush Ryan as he\\'s leaving work. Ryan notices Clark idling nearby. Clark casually walks away, but Ryan clearly unnerved, then gets even more nervous as he hears a car engine starting. His suspicions are well warranted-as he continues walking down the street, he looks in the reflection of a parked van\\'s rearview door and sees that Clark, and the stolen car driven by Annette, are following him. Ryan pretends not to see them until he\\'s walking past a parked panel truck, at which point he ducks behind the truck. Clark draws a silenced pistol and prepares to corner Ryan, but Ryan attacks him first. Clark quickly gets the upper hand and throws Ryan to the curb. He grabs his pistol and is about to shoot Ryan when he\\'s shot dead himself by a US Marine sentry. Annette quickly drives away in her Jeep. Ryan, realizing that Miller is going to target Cathy and Sally, jumps into his car and drives off.Simultaneously, Miller and the other henchman follow Cathy as she picks up Sally from school, with Miller riding shotgun. They prepare to follow the two, but are temporarily held up by a crossing guard. Once the crossing guard clears, they pursue her to US Highway 50. Ryan tries to frantically call Cathy on his car phone, but she is busy answering phone calls from the hospital. As he\\'s trying to connect with her, Miller and his henchman recklessly weave in and out of traffic to catch up with Cathy. Ryan eventually gets through to Cathy and tells her to get off the highway and find the nearest police station. Unfortunately, just as the call ends, Miller\\'s van comes charging up on her using the left shoulder. Miller moves to the backseat of the van, grabs a submachine gun, and slides open the door. Another car momentarily delays him, but once he has a clear aim, Miller opens fire, spraying Cathy\\'s car with bullets. A multicar pileup ensues as Cathy loses control of her car and crashes head-on into a concrete barrier. Ryan, who has found himself stuck in traffic headed in the other direction, sees the smoke from the crash and realizes the worst.Cathy and Sally are airlifted to a nearby hospital for treatment. Enraged over the near-loss of his family, Ryan decides to go back to work for the CIA, having earlier rejected the appeal of his former superior, Vice Admiral James Greer (James Earl Jones).Ryan\\'s tireless work leads him to conclude that Miller has taken refuge in a training camp, one of many located in Libya. He also determines that a recent new arrival at the camp may be one of O\\'Donnell\\'s English informants, Dennis Cooley. Ryan makes his recommendations to his superiors at the CIA. Greer invites Jack to a live feed of an SAS strike team attack on the camp. Everyone in the camp is eliminated but unbeknownst to the CIA and Ryan, Miller and his companions have already fled the camp and are on their way to the US to stage their next attack on Lord Holmes.Lord Holmes decides to visit Ryan at his home to formally present his KCVO. With the aid of Lord Holmes\\' traitorous assistant, Miller\\'s group tracks Holmes to this location, kills the Diplomatic Security Service agents and Maryland state troopers guarding the house, and attempts once more to kidnap Lord Holmes. Ryan leads Holmes and his family to safety while he attempts to lure Miller and his companions away from his home.The FBI Hostage Rescue Teams are scrambled to pick up Holmes. Upon realising that Ryan is leading them away from Holmes, Miller\\'s companions try to persuade Miller to turn around, but an enraged and deranged Miller kills his terrorist companions and continues his pursuit of Ryan. Ryan and Miller fight hand to hand; Miller is killed when Ryan impales him backward on a boat anchor, and his body is obliterated in the subsequent explosion of the craft.Credits roll just after Caroline Ryan learns the gender of the child she is going to have, and before she tells Jack and Sally.',\n",
              "  'Four boys around the age of 10 are friends in Brooklyn during the \\'50s. They have a nickname, the Flatbush Four, and also pal around with a girl. One day they get into a scuffle at a store with a young thug, and steal a bottle of scotch as they run away.58 years later: Sam has retired with his wife to Naples, FL; Archie is living with his son in New Jersey; Paddy lives alone in Brooklyn after his wife Sophie died a year earlier; Billy is wealthy and living in Malibu, CA with a young woman named Lisa.Billy goes to the funeral for his friend Ronnie, and in the process of eulogizing him, while commenting on the shortness of life and love, he spontaneously proposes to Lisa.Billy conference calls Sam and Archie to tell them he is getting married that weekend in Las Vegas, and they not only want to come to the wedding, they want to throw him a bachelor party the night before. All three of them dread calling Paddy though.Sam\\'s wife sends him off to Vegas with a condom, telling him he can do what he likes to get some life back in him. Sam goes to New Jersey and picks up Archie, and they both go to see Paddy, but he is reluctant to go with them to Vegas. He begins complaining about their old friend Billy, and continues to ruminate about him for the whole trip.When the three friends get to the Vegas airport, Paddy is unhappy when Billy meets them there, still upset about something in their recent past.They go to Binion\\'s casino downtown, but soon learn that the hotel portion is closed. They hear a singer in the lounge named Diana and they invite her to have a drink with them. Paddy explains that the reason they have been arguing is that Billy did not come to the funeral for his wife Sophie a year ago.They invite Diana to walk down the Strip with them to the Aria, where Billy is planning his wedding service.Sam chats up a woman at the Aria bar who turns out to be a drag queen. Billy goes to survey the hotel chapel with Diana. Paddy watches Archie win $87,000 on a blackjack table. All four of them are invited to judge a bikini contest at the pool.The Aria management approaches Archie and invites him to stay in a luxury suite with his friends because he won so much. The men like the swank penthouse, but Paddy is still bitter toward Billy and refuses to go with them to the hotel\\'s nightclub.The other three go to the nightclub, where they pay an outrageous fee to get a VIP table. They drink well, chat up some young women, and almost get into a fight with a young thug, whom Paddy shows up to beat down.The next morning, Paddy visits Diana at Binion\\'s, and takes her on a walk to tell her more about his life after his wife died. He clearly feels sweet toward her.Paddy finds Billy back at the Aria and asks him if he really loves Lisa, pointing out that he is 69 and Lisa is 31, and he does not seem to really love her. Before they can finish talking, Sam and Archie come by, and a hotel agent brings the thug from the night before to apologize to them.Billy goes to visit Diana at Binion\\'s, and explains that when the guys were 17, Sophie loved him and Paddy both. Because he could tell Paddy was better for her, he told her to choose Paddy. Now he clearly feels sweet toward Diana.After much local advertising, the guys throw a huge party in their suite, with beaucoup dancing and drinking. Archie is surprised when his son shows up out of concern about him, but Archie explains that he is finally having some fun. Sam gets a girl to go to a bedroom with him, ready to have sex, but then tells her he can\\'t do it because he\\'s thinking of his wife. Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson shows up but he can\\'t get in.Billy realizes that Paddy has invited Diana to the party, and Paddy realizes that Billy is attracted to her as well. When she shows up, Billy bumps Paddy into a small pool and takes Diana to a room. As Diana begins to protest that Billy wants to push Paddy on her just like he did with Sophie when they were teens, Paddy overhears and becomes quite upset.The next morning by the hotel pool, Paddy tells Billy that he can tell he does not really love Lisa and should not marry her. Just then Lisa shows up for the wedding, but Paddy pushes Billy into the pool and approaches Lisa to say he is simply returning the favor of making sure Billy ends up with the right woman.Billy and Lisa evidently break up as the other guys watch from a distance.Back in the hotel suite, Billy gets upset in front of the other guys, confessing he is scared of being old, and his life is \"winding up a little too fast.\" He apologizes to Paddy for not coming to Sophie\\'s funeral. They all affirm their friendship, and Paddy tells Billy he should go see Diana.Billy goes to Binion\\'s lounge and slowly takes Diana in an embrace. Good kiss.As they are preparing to leave the suite, the four friends open the bottle of scotch they had stolen 58 years earlier, and make a toast. Alas, the scotch has not aged as well as they have.The four friends separate at the airport, and wonder about what they could do the next year to get together for fun.58 days later: Billy calls his three friends from Malibu to tell them he\\'s getting married to Diana. Paddy is happy for him, but has to get going to a concert with a neighbor lady. Archie is happy too, but is tending to his grandson. Sam can\\'t quite answer the phone, because he\\'s been in bed making love with his wife.']}"

Lincoln must, by almost any means possible, obtain enough votes from a recalcitrant Congress before peace arrives and it is too late. Yet the president is torn, as an early peace would save thousands of lives. As the nation confronts its conscience over the freedom of its entire population, Lincoln faces his own crisis of conscience -- end slavery or end the war.

This movie could have been a hundred times better with puppets, something Jim Henson style, but they always go for the cheap and cheesy animation these days, and the product of that is a seemingly endless stream of easily forgotten movies that are saturating the film industry and turning the video game industry into a bad scene of movie games as well.

However, Mumble has an astute talent for something that none of the penguins had ever seen before: tap dancing. Though Mumble\\'s mom, Norma Jean, thinks this little habit is cute, his dad, Memphis, says it \"just ain\\'t penguin.\" Besides, they both know that, without a Heartsong, Mumble may never find true love. As fate would have it, his one friend, Gloria, happens to be the best singer around. Mumble and Gloria have a connection from the moment they hatch, but she struggles with his strange \"hippity- hoppity\" ways. Mumble is just too different--especially for Noah the Elder, the stern leader of Emperor Land, who ultimately casts him out of the community. Away from home for the first time, Mumble meets a posse of decidedly un-Emperor-like penguins--the Adelie Amigos. Led by Ramon, the Adelies instantly embrace Mumble\\'s cool dance moves and invite him to party with...                Written by\\nAnthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com>'}"
